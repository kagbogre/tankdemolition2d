# Tank Demolition 2D
A basic hackable 2D top-down tank game made in pure Java 8 as a class project.

I did this to basically learn a bit about core game dev and how to organize game loops with networking functionality.

I learned all the concepts of 2D game development in Java used in this project from this wonderful series on how to make a Space Invaders game with Java2D: http://www.cokeandcode.com/info/tut2d.html.

I did not consider adding security and anti-hacking because it was pretty out of the scope of the assigment. But a lot of server-side checks would need to be made here, especially for collisions.
